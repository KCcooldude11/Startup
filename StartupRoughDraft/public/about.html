          Synopsis:
        </h2>
        <p><br>The world is divided into four kingdoms, each represented by the element they harness, <br>
          and peace has lasted throughout the realms of Water, Air, Earth, and Fire under the supervision of the Avatar,<br>
           a link to the spirit world and the only being capable of mastering the use of all four elements. <br>
           When young Avatar Aang disappears, the Fire Nation launches an attack to eradicate all members of <br>
           the Air Nomads to prevent interference in their future plans for world domination. <br>
           100 years pass and current Fire Lord Ozai continues to conquer and imprison anyone with <br>
           elemental "bending" abilities in the Earth and Water Kingdoms, while siblings Katara and Sokka <br>
           from a Southern Water Tribe find a mysterious boy trapped beneath the ice outside their village.<br>
            Upon rescuing him, he reveals himself to be Aang, Avatar and last of the Air Nomads. Swearing to <br>
            protect the Avatar, Katara and Sokka journey with him to the Northern Water Kingdom in his quest <br>
            to master "Waterbending" and eventually fulfill his destiny of once again restoring peace to the world.<br>
             But as they inch nearer to their goal, the group must evade Prince Zuko, the exiled son of Lord Ozai, <br>
             Commander Zhao, the Fire Nation's military leader, and the tyrannical onslaught of the evil Fire Lord himself.<br>
