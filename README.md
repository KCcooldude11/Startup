# Startup

This will be a file for new discoveries, questions and things that I learn in my CS260 class.


I learned how to deal with merge conflicts, and the do's and dont's of pulling and pushing.


Here is my Pitch for my startup Website:

I had the idea to create a website a little like pottermore which is a website that allows fans of Harry Potter to take a little interactive quiz to be 'sorted' into their very own hogwarts house. Instead of focused on the harry potter houses though, I plan to make a website that allows its users to take a quiz-like experience to be sorted into one of the 4 types of elemental benders from Avatar the Last Airbender. I plan to make it stylistically appealing, as well as a little complex allowing its users to try many different combinations of answers to have a unique chance of being put into an element.

Other than the main feature of the quiz, I might implement an easter egg of allowing a certain sequence of answers to the quiz to allow the user to be sorted not into one element, but all 4, and thus becoming the "avatar". At the end of the quiz the user will be greeted with an artistic representation of their particular element/nation.

So for future reference, when navigating vim, typing i puts you into insert mode where you can edit files. Pressing ESC will then get you out of insert mode. Finally, typing :wq will write to the file (w) and quit (q)
Also, be very careful when typing file names to get them exactly correct. for example when typing "sudo vim Caddyfile" do NOT type CaddyFile. This will create a new file rather than access the already existing Caddyfile.

Here are some html special characters that have codes to put them on the page:
& = &amp;
< = &lt;
> = &gt;
smiley face = &#128512;

Simon.Html reflection:
From working on the simon.html assignment I learned about hexadecimal colors, and how to apply both normal predefined colors and hexadecimal colors to text and shapes. I also learned about changing font, size and positioning of text, as well as how to take input from users in multiple different ways like buttons, uploading files, emails etc.

CSS - you can add a shadow to text using the following:
text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
the px numbers specify the xyz positioning of the shadow, and the #cccccc tells it to be black.

Simon CSS:
From this assignment I learned much more about how to impliment CSS boostrap, CSS, and basic HTML in many different ways. For example I messed around first just with a basic paragraph in html and used basic css to format a line on the score.html text page. Then I messed around with the original code for that page having to do with bootstrap tables, and found out how they work and how simple yet clean they look!

I also learned how to take images from the web and set them as a a background, and how you can do so for any different block of the page such as a header, footer, main etc.
